Welcome to NZ-SeQTech's documentation!
===================================

**NZ-SeQTech** is a Python library designed to facilitate DNA sequence encoding in quantum machine learning applications. With NZ-SeQTech, you can effortlessly encode DNA sequences using various data encoding techniques we have developed and discussed in our article ðŸ“„ `Classical-to-Quantum Sequence Encoding in Genomics <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370213316_Classical-to-Quantum_Sequence_Encoding_in_Genomics>`_. This library is distributed under the Apache license.
