Data Preprocessing Guide
==================================================


In the context of the NZ-SeQTech Machine Learning models (classical and quantum):

- **X and Y:** These are the input features and target labels used for QML models.
- **X_train, Y_train, X_test, and Y_test:** These are the input features and target labels used for classical ML models.

Data Preprocessing
-------------------

Enhancing Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data preprocessing is crucial to ensure the data is suitable for both QML and classical ML models. Here's how it's done:

1. **Data Collection:**
   Gather the raw data from your source.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   Handle missing values, outliers, and data quality issues.

   .. code-block:: python

      # Python Instruction for Data Cleaning:
      import pandas as pd

      # Load the dataset
      data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

      # Data Cleaning
      # Handle missing values, outliers, etc.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   Create meaningful features and transform the data.

   .. code-block:: python

      # Python Instruction for Feature Engineering:
      # Feature scaling, one-hot encoding, etc.
      # Perform necessary transformations on the data.

Handling Missing Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dealing with Missing Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Handling missing values is a critical preprocessing step. Strategies include:

- **Imputation:**
  Fill missing values with statistics like mean, median, or mode.

  .. code-block:: python

      # Python Instruction for Imputation:
      # Example: Filling missing values with the mean
      data.fillna(data.mean(), inplace=True)

- **Removal:**
  Remove rows or columns with missing data if appropriate.

  .. code-block:: python

      # Python Instruction for Removal:
      # Example: Removing rows with missing values
      data.dropna(axis=0, inplace=True)

- **Advanced Techniques:**
  Use advanced methods like interpolation or machine learning-based imputation.

Feature Engineering Techniques
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enhancing Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Feature engineering techniques improve model performance. Some methods include:

- **Scaling:**
  Normalize or standardize numerical features.

  .. code-block:: python

      # Python Instruction for Scaling:
      # Example: Scaling numerical features using Min-Max scaling
      from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

      scaler = MinMaxScaler()
      data[['feature_1', 'feature_2']] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['feature_1', 'feature_2']])

- **One-Hot Encoding:**
  Convert categorical variables into binary form.

  .. code-block:: python

      # Python Instruction for One-Hot Encoding:
      # Example: One-hot encoding of categorical variables
      data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['categorical_feature'])

- **Feature Selection:**
  Choose relevant features based on analysis or feature importance.

  .. code-block:: python

      # Python Instruction for Feature Selection:
      # Example: Selecting the top k features based on feature importance
      from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif

      k = 5  # Number of top features to select
      selector = SelectKBest(score_func=f_classif, k=k)
      X_selected = selector.fit_transform(data.drop('target', axis=1), data['target'])

- **Feature Creation:**
  Generate new features through transformations.

  .. code-block:: python

      # Python Instruction for Feature Creation:
      # Example: Creating a new feature by combining existing features
      data['new_feature'] = data['feature_1'] + data['feature_2']

Train-Test Split
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To evaluate the performance of our models, you will need to split the preprocessed data into two parts:

- **X_train:** The input features for training classical ML models.
- **Y_train:** The target labels for training classical ML models.
- **X_test:** The input features for testing classical ML models.
- **Y_test:** The target labels for testing classical ML models.
- **X:** The input features for QML models.
- **Y:** The target labels for QML models.

.. code-block:: python

   # Python Instruction for Train-Test Split:
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

   # Split the data into training and testing sets
   X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

   # Save X_train, X_test, Y_train, and Y_test as .npy files
   import numpy as np
   np.save('X.npy', X)
   np.save('Y.npy', Y)
   np.save('X_train.npy', X_train)
   np.save('X_test.npy', X_test)
   np.save('Y_train.npy', Y_train)
   np.save('Y_test.npy', Y_test)

These saved files (``X.npy``, ``Y.npy``, ``X_train.npy``, ``X_test.npy``, ``Y_train.npy``, and ``Y_test.npy``) contain the preprocessed data and can be easily loaded as inputs for testing our models.
